2. Verify that data is being fetched from your integrations
3. Ensure the integration is active and connected

### Missing Event Details
If event details are incomplete:
1. Check the integration's data fetching status
2. Verify that the integration has the necessary permissions
3. Some integrations may have limited data availability

### Search Not Working
If search isn't finding expected results:
1. Try different search terms
2. Check spelling and case sensitivity
3. Some fields may not be searchable depending on the integration
